# SHATTERED-Dev-3
The third snippet of my indie game.



# Changes
I have changed the enemy to a ghoul (which to me is a cross between a ghost and a goblin with a lot of emphasis on the ghost). When the ghoul gets close enough to you, with will spin rapidly (not a glitch) and particles will appear around it. When it gets within attacking distance, it will become tinted blue. If attacked, it will recieve knockback. Another minor change is that the items in the inventory are spaced apart now.



### Notes
Please see first entry for compilation instructions. There is no license, everything is completely free to use, and all of the artwork (and any future music/sound effects I may add) is completely made by me. As you can see, I'm quite the artist ;-)
